# User-defined functions

ZetaSQL
supports user-defined functions (UDFs). A UDF enables you to create a function
using another SQL expression or another programming
language, such as JavaScript or Lua. These functions accept columns of input
and perform actions, returning the result of those actions as a value.

## SQL UDFs 
<a id="sql_udfs"></a>

A SQL user-defined function (UDF) is a user-defined function that operates on
one row at a time and returns the result of that calculation as a single value.

All of the arguments are expressions that are computed in the context of a
single row.

### Create a SQL UDF

You can create a SQL UDF using the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE [ { TEMPORARY | TEMP } ] FUNCTION
  function_name ( [ function_parameter [, ...] ] )
  [ RETURNS data_type ]
  AS ( function_body )

function_parameter:
  parameter_name { data_type | ANY TYPE }
  [ DEFAULT default_value ]
```

This syntax consists of the following components:

+ `CREATE ... FUNCTION`: Creates a new function. A function
  can have zero or more function parameters.

    + `TEMPORARY` or `TEMP`: Indicates that the function is temporary; that is,
      it exists for the lifetime of the session. A temporary function can have
      the same name as a built-in function. If this happens, the
      temporary function hides the built-in function for the duration of the
      temporary function's lifetime.
+ `function_name`: The name of the function.
+ `function_parameter`: A parameter for the function.

    + `parameter_name`: The name of the function parameter.

    + `data_type`: A ZetaSQL [data type][data-types].

    
    + `ANY TYPE`: The function will accept an argument of any type for this
      function parameter. If more than one parameter includes `ANY TYPE`,
      a relationship is not enforced between these parameters when the function
      is defined. However, if the type of argument passed into the function at
      call time is incompatible with the function definition, this will
      result in an error.

      `ANY TYPE` is a [_templated function parameter_][templated-parameters].
    

    
    + `DEFAULT default_value`: If an argument is not provided for a function
      parameter, `default_value` is used. `default_value` must be a literal
      or `NULL` value. All function parameters following this one
      must also have default values.
    

    
+ `RETURNS data_type`: Optional clause that specifies the data type
  that the function returns. ZetaSQL infers the result type
  of the function from the SQL function body when the `RETURN` clause is
  omitted.
+ `function_body`: The SQL expression that defines the function body.

### Call a SQL UDF

You can call a SQL UDF in the same way that you call a built-in function.
For details, see [Function calls][function-calls].

### SQL UDF examples

The following example shows a UDF that employs a SQL function.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION AddFourAndDivide(x INT64, y INT64)
RETURNS DOUBLE
AS (
  (x + 4) / y
);

WITH
  numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS val UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS val UNION ALL
    SELECT 4 AS val UNION ALL
    SELECT 5 AS val
  )
SELECT val, AddFourAndDivide(val, 2) AS result
FROM numbers;

+-----+--------+
| val | result |
+-----+--------+
| 1   | 2.5    |
| 3   | 3.5    |
| 4   | 4      |
| 5   | 4.5    |
+-----+--------+
```

The following example shows a SQL UDF that uses the
templated function parameter, `ANY TYPE`. The resulting function accepts
arguments of various types.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION AddFourAndDivideAny(x ANY TYPE, y ANY TYPE)
AS (
  (x + 4) / y
);

SELECT
  AddFourAndDivideAny(3, 4) AS integer_input,
  AddFourAndDivideAny(1.59, 3.14) AS floating_point_input;

+----------------+-----------------------+
| integer_input  | floating_point_input  |
+----------------+-----------------------+
| 1.75           | 1.7802547770700636    |
+----------------+-----------------------+
```

The following example shows a SQL UDF that uses the
templated function parameter, `ANY TYPE`, to return the last element of an
array of any type.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION LastArrayElement(arr ANY TYPE)
AS (
  arr[ORDINAL(ARRAY_LENGTH(arr))]
);

SELECT
  names[OFFSET(0)] AS first_name,
  LastArrayElement(names) AS last_name
FROM
  (
    SELECT ['Fred', 'McFeely', 'Rogers'] AS names UNION ALL
    SELECT ['Marie', 'Sk≈Çodowska', 'Curie']
  );

+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| Fred       | Rogers    |
| Marie      | Curie     |
+------------+-----------+
```

## JavaScript UDFs 
<a id="javascript_udfs"></a>

A JavaScript UDF is a JavaScript user-defined function that executes
JavaScript code and returns the result as a single value.

### Create a JavaScript UDF

You can create a JavaScript UDF using the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE [ { TEMPORARY | TEMP } ] FUNCTION
  function_name ( [ function_parameter [, ...] ] )
  RETURNS data_type
  [ determinism_specifier ]
  LANGUAGE js AS function_body

function_parameter:
  parameter_name { data_type | ANY TYPE }
  [ DEFAULT default_value ]

determinism_specifier:
  { IMMUTABLE | DETERMINISTIC | NOT DETERMINISTIC | VOLATILE | STABLE }
```

This syntax consists of the following components:

+ `CREATE ... FUNCTION`: Creates a new function. A function
  can have zero or more function parameters.

    + `TEMPORARY` or `TEMP`: Indicates that the function is temporary; that is,
      it exists for the lifetime of the session. A temporary function can have
      the same name as a built-in function. If this happens, the
      temporary function hides the built-in function for the duration of the
      temporary function's lifetime.
+ `function_name`: The name of the function.
+ `function_parameter`: A parameter for the function.

    + `parameter_name`: The name of the function parameter.

    + `data_type`: A ZetaSQL [data type][data-types].
      See [SQL type encodings in JavaScript][javascript-data-types] to learn
      how ZetaSQL represents JavaScript types.

    
    + `ANY TYPE`: The function will accept an argument of any type for this
      function parameter. If more than one parameter includes `ANY TYPE`,
      a relationship is not enforced between these parameters when the function
      is defined. However, if the type of argument passed into the function at
      call time is incompatible with the function definition, this will
      result in an error.

      `ANY TYPE` is a [_templated function parameter_][templated-parameters].
    

    
    + `DEFAULT default_value`: If an argument is not provided for a function
      parameter, `default_value` is used. `default_value` must be a literal
      or `NULL` value. All function parameters following this one
      must also have default values.
    

    
+ `determinism_specifier`: Identifies the determinism property of the
  function, which impacts query semantics and planning. Your choices are:

    + `IMMUTABLE` or `DETERMINISTIC`: The function always returns the same
      result when passed the same arguments. For example, if the function
      `add_one(i)` always returns `i + 1`, the function is deterministic.

    + `NOT DETERMINISTIC`: The function does not always return the same result
      when passed the same arguments. The `VOLATILE` and `STABLE` keywords are
      subcategories of `NOT DETERMINISTIC`.

    + `VOLATILE`: The function does not always return the same result when
      passed the same arguments, even within the same run of a query
      statement. For example if `add_random(i)` returns `i + rand()`, the
      function is volatile, because every call to the function can return a
      different result.

    + `STABLE`: Within one execution of a statement, the function will
      consistently return the same result for the same argument values.
      However, the result could change for different executions of the
      same statement. For example if you invoke the function
      `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` multiple times within a single statement, it will
      return the same result, but it may return different results in
      subsequent statement executions.
+ `RETURNS data_type`: Specifies the ZetaSQL data type that the
  function returns.
+ `function_body`: The JavaScript code that defines the function body.
  This must be a string literal.

<a id="quoting_rules"></a>
You must enclose JavaScript in quotes. There are a few options:

+ `"..."`: For simple, one line code snippets that don't contain quotes or
  escaping, you can use a standard quoted string.
+ `"""..."""`: If the snippet contains quotes or multiple lines, use
  triple-quoted blocks.
+ `R"""..."""`: If the snippet contains escaping, prefix a triple-quoted
  block with an `R` to indicate that this is a raw string that should ignore
  escaping rules. If you are not sure which quoting style to use, this one
  will provide the most consistent results.

### Call a JavaScript UDF

You can call a JavaScript UDF in the same way that you call a built-in
function. For details, see [Function calls][function-calls].

### SQL type encodings in JavaScript 
<a id="javascript_udf_data_types"></a>

ZetaSQL represents types in the following manner:

<table>
  <tr>
  <th>SQL Data Type</th>

### JavaScript UDF examples

The following example creates a persistent JavaScript UDF.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x*y;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x, y, MultiplyInputs(x, y) as product
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+
| x   | y   | product      |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1   | 5   | 5            |
| 2   | 10  | 20           |
| 3   | 15  | 45           |
+-----+-----+--------------+
```

The following example creates a temporary JavaScript UDF.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x*y;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x, y, MultiplyInputs(x, y) as product
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+
| x   | y   | product      |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1   | 5   | 5            |
| 2   | 10  | 20           |
| 3   | 15  | 45           |
+-----+-----+--------------+
```

You can create multiple JavaScript UDFs before a query. For example:

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x*y;
""";
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION DivideByTwo(x DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x / 2;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x,
  y,
  MultiplyInputs(x, y) as product,
  DivideByTwo(x) as half_x,
  DivideByTwo(y) as half_y
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+--------+--------+
| x   | y   | product      | half_x | half_y |
+-----+-----+--------------+--------+--------+
| 1   | 5   | 5            | 0.5    | 2.5    |
| 2   | 10  | 20           | 1      | 5      |
| 3   | 15  | 45           | 1.5    | 7.5    |
+-----+-----+--------------+--------+--------+
```

You can pass the result of a JavaScript UDF as input to another UDF.
For example:

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x*y;
""";
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION DivideByTwo(x DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x/2;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x,
  y,
  MultiplyInputs(DivideByTwo(x), DivideByTwo(y)) as half_product
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+
| x   | y   | half_product |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1   | 5   | 1.25         |
| 2   | 10  | 5            |
| 3   | 15  | 11.25        |
+-----+-----+--------------+
```

The following example shows how you can use a JavaScript UDF with
default values.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION AddValues(x INT64, y INT64 DEFAULT 50, z INT64 DEFAULT 100)
RETURNS INT64
LANGUAGE js AS """
  return x*y*z;
""";

SELECT AddValues(1, 2) AS result;

+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 200    |
+--------+
```

The following provides an example of a simple, single statement JavaScript UDF:

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION PlusOne(x DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE js
AS "return x+1;";
SELECT val, PlusOne(val) AS result
FROM UNNEST([1, 2, 3]) AS val;

+-----------+-----------+
| val       | result    |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 4         |
+-----------+-----------+
```

The following example illustrates a more complex, multi-statement
JavaScript UDF.  Note that a triple-quoted multi-line string is used in this
example for readability.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION CustomGreeting(a STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js
AS """
  var d = new Date();
  if (d.getHours() < 12) {
    return 'Good Morning, ' + a + '!';
  } else {
    return 'Good Evening, ' + a + '!';
  }
  """;
SELECT CustomGreeting(names) as everyone
FROM UNNEST(["Hannah", "Max", "Jakob"]) AS names;

+-----------------------+
| everyone              |
+-----------------------+
| Good Morning, Hannah! |
| Good Morning, Max!    |
| Good Morning, Jakob!  |
+-----------------------+
```

The following example demonstrates how to utilize JavaScript escaping within the
triple-quoted multi-line string.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION PlusOne(x STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js
AS R"""
var re = /[a-z]/g;
return x.match(re);
""";

SELECT val, PlusOne(val) AS result
FROM UNNEST(['ab-c', 'd_e', '!']) AS val;

+---------+
| result  |
+---------+
| [a,b,c] |
| [d,e]   |
| NULL    |
+---------+
```

The following example sums the values of all
fields named `foo` in the given JSON string.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION SumFieldsNamedFoo(json_row STRING)
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE js
AS """
function SumFoo(obj) {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var field in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(field) && obj[field] != null) {
      if (typeof obj[field] == "object") {
        sum += SumFoo(obj[field]);
      } else if (field == "foo") {
        sum += obj[field];
      }
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
var row = JSON.parse(json_row);
return SumFoo(row);
""";

WITH
  Input AS (
    SELECT
      STRUCT(1 AS foo, 2 AS bar, STRUCT('foo' AS x, 3.14 AS foo) AS baz) AS s,
      10 AS foo
    UNION ALL
    SELECT NULL, 4 AS foo
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      STRUCT(NULL, 2 AS bar, STRUCT('fizz' AS x, 1.59 AS foo) AS baz) AS s,
      NULL AS foo
  )
SELECT
  TO_JSON_STRING(t) AS json_row,
  SumFieldsNamedFoo(TO_JSON_STRING(t)) AS foo_sum
FROM Input AS t;

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| json_row                                                            | foo_sum |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| {"s":{"foo":1,"bar":2,"baz":{"x":"foo","foo":3.14}},"foo":10}       | 14.14   |
| {"s":null,"foo":4}                                                  | 4       |
| {"s":{"foo":null,"bar":2,"baz":{"x":"fizz","foo":1.59}},"foo":null} | 1.59    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

## LUA UDFs 
<a id="lua_udfs"></a>

A LUA UDF is a SQL user-defined function that executes LUA code and returns the
result as a single value.

### Create a LUA UDF

You can create a LUA UDF using the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE [ { TEMPORARY | TEMP } ] FUNCTION
  function_name ( [ function_parameter [, ...] ] )
  RETURNS data_type
  [ determinism_specifier ]
  LANGUAGE lua AS function_body

function_parameter:
  parameter_name { data_type | ANY TYPE }
  [ DEFAULT default_value ]

determinism_specifier:
  { IMMUTABLE | DETERMINISTIC | NOT DETERMINISTIC | VOLATILE | STABLE }
```

This syntax consists of the following components:

+ `CREATE ... FUNCTION`: Creates a new function. A function
  can have zero or more function parameters.

    + `TEMPORARY` or `TEMP`: Indicates that the function is temporary; that is,
      it exists for the lifetime of the session. A temporary function can have
      the same name as a built-in function. If this happens, the
      temporary function hides the built-in function for the duration of the
      temporary function's lifetime.
+ `function_name`: The name of the function.
+ `function_parameter`: A parameter for the function.

    + `parameter_name`: The name of the function parameter.

    + `data_type`: A ZetaSQL [data type][data-types].

    
    + `ANY TYPE`: The function will accept an argument of any type for this
      function parameter. If more than one parameter includes `ANY TYPE`,
      a relationship is not enforced between these parameters when the function
      is defined. However, if the type of argument passed into the function at
      call time is incompatible with the function definition, this will
      result in an error.

      `ANY TYPE` is a [_templated function parameter_][templated-parameters].
    

    
    + `DEFAULT default_value`: If an argument is not provided for a function
      parameter, `default_value` is used. `default_value` must be a literal
      or `NULL` value. All function parameters following this one
      must also have default values.
    

    
+ `determinism_specifier`: Identifies the determinism property of the
  function, which impacts query semantics and planning. Your choices are:

    + `IMMUTABLE` or `DETERMINISTIC`: The function always returns the same
      result when passed the same arguments. For example, if the function
      `add_one(i)` always returns `i + 1`, the function is deterministic.

    + `NOT DETERMINISTIC`: The function does not always return the same result
      when passed the same arguments. The `VOLATILE` and `STABLE` keywords are
      subcategories of `NOT DETERMINISTIC`.

    + `VOLATILE`: The function does not always return the same result when
      passed the same arguments, even within the same run of a query
      statement. For example if `add_random(i)` returns `i + rand()`, the
      function is volatile, because every call to the function can return a
      different result.

    + `STABLE`: Within one execution of a statement, the function will
      consistently return the same result for the same argument values.
      However, the result could change for different executions of the
      same statement. For example if you invoke the function
      `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` multiple times within a single statement, it will
      return the same result, but it may return different results in
      subsequent statement executions.
+ `RETURNS data_type`: Specifies the ZetaSQL data type that the
  function returns.
+ `function_body`: The LUA code that defines the function body.
  This must be a string literal.

<a id="quoting_rules"></a>
You must enclose LUA in quotes. There are a few options:

+ `"..."`: For simple, one line code snippets that don't contain quotes or
  escaping, you can use a standard quoted string.
+ `"""..."""`: If the snippet contains quotes or multiple lines, use
  triple-quoted blocks.
+ `R"""..."""`: If the snippet contains escaping, prefix a triple-quoted
  block with an `R` to indicate that this is a raw string that should ignore
  escaping rules. If you are not sure which quoting style to use, this one
  will provide the most consistent results.

### Call a LUA UDF

You can call a JavaScript UDF in the same way that you call a built-in
function. For details, see [Function calls][function-calls].

### LUA UDF examples

The following example creates a persistent LUA UDF.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x*y;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x, y, MultiplyInputs(x, y) as product
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+
| x   | y   | product      |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1   | 5   | 5            |
| 2   | 10  | 20           |
| 3   | 15  | 45           |
+-----+-----+--------------+
```

The following example creates a temporary LUA UDF.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x*y;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x, y, MultiplyInputs(x, y) as product
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+
| x   | y   | product      |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1   | 5   | 5            |
| 2   | 10  | 20           |
| 3   | 15  | 45           |
+-----+-----+--------------+
```

You can create multiple LUA UDFs before a query. For example:

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x*y;
""";
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION DivideByTwo(x DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x / 2;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x,
  y,
  MultiplyInputs(x, y) as product,
  DivideByTwo(x) as half_x,
  DivideByTwo(y) as half_y
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+--------+--------+
| x   | y   | product      | half_x | half_y |
+-----+-----+--------------+--------+--------+
| 1   | 5   | 5            | 0.5    | 2.5    |
| 2   | 10  | 20           | 1      | 5      |
| 3   | 15  | 45           | 1.5    | 7.5    |
+-----+-----+--------------+--------+--------+
```

You can pass the result of a LUA UDF as input to another UDF.
For example:

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION MultiplyInputs(x DOUBLE, y DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x*y;
""";
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION DivideByTwo(x DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x/2;
""";
WITH numbers AS
  (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
SELECT x,
  y,
  MultiplyInputs(DivideByTwo(x), DivideByTwo(y)) as half_product
FROM numbers;

+-----+-----+--------------+
| x   | y   | half_product |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1   | 5   | 1.25         |
| 2   | 10  | 5            |
| 3   | 15  | 11.25        |
+-----+-----+--------------+
```

The following example shows how you can use a LUA UDF with
default values.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION AddValues(x INT64, y INT64 DEFAULT 50, z INT64 DEFAULT 100)
RETURNS INT64
LANGUAGE lua AS """
  return x*y*z;
""";

SELECT AddValues(1, 2) AS result;

+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 200    |
+--------+
```

The following provides an example of a simple, single statement LUA UDF:

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION PlusOne(x DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE lua
AS "return x+1;";

SELECT val, PlusOne(val) AS result
FROM UNNEST([1, 2, 3]) AS val;

+-----------+-----------+
| val       | result    |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 4         |
+-----------+-----------+
```

The following example illustrates a more complex, multi-statement
LUA UDF.  Note that a triple-quoted multi-line string is used in this
example for readability.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION CustomGreeting(i INT32)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE lua
AS """
  if i < 12 then
    return 'Good Morning!'
  else
    return 'Good Evening!'
  end
  """;

SELECT CustomGreeting(13) AS message;

+---------------+
| message       |
+---------------+
| Good Evening! |
+---------------+
```

The following example demonstrates how to utilize LUA escaping within the
triple-quoted multi-line string.

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION Alphabet()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE lua
AS R"""
  return 'A\tB\tC'
  """;

SELECT Alphabet() AS result;

+---------+
| result  |
+---------+
| A  B  C |
+---------+
```

## Templated function parameters

A templated function parameter can match more than one argument type at
function call time. If a function signature includes a
templated function parameter, ZetaSQL allows function calls
to pass to the function any argument type as long as the function body is
valid for that argument type.
