# Datetime functions

ZetaSQL supports the following `DATETIME` functions.

### CURRENT_DATETIME

```sql
CURRENT_DATETIME([time_zone])
```

**Description**

Returns the current time as a `DATETIME` object. Parentheses are optional when
called with no arguments.

This function supports an optional `time_zone` parameter.
See [Time zone definitions][datetime-link-to-timezone-definitions] for
information on how to specify a time zone.

**Return Data Type**

`DATETIME`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATETIME() as now;

+----------------------------+
| now                        |
+----------------------------+
| 2016-05-19 10:38:47.046465 |
+----------------------------+
```

When a column named `current_datetime` is present, the column name and the
function call without parentheses are ambiguous. To ensure the function call,
add parentheses; to ensure the column name, qualify it with its
[range variable][datetime-functions-link-to-range-variables]. For example, the
following query will select the function in the `now` column and the table
column in the `current_datetime` column.

```sql
WITH t AS (SELECT 'column value' AS `current_datetime`)
SELECT current_datetime() as now, t.current_datetime FROM t;

+----------------------------+------------------+
| now                        | current_datetime |
+----------------------------+------------------+
| 2016-05-19 10:38:47.046465 | column value     |
+----------------------------+------------------+
```

### DATETIME

```sql
1. DATETIME(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
2. DATETIME(date_expression[, time_expression])
3. DATETIME(timestamp_expression [, time_zone])
```

**Description**

1. Constructs a `DATETIME` object using `INT64` values
   representing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.
2. Constructs a `DATETIME` object using a DATE object and an optional `TIME`
   object.
3. Constructs a `DATETIME` object using a `TIMESTAMP` object. It supports an
   optional parameter to
   [specify a time zone][datetime-link-to-timezone-definitions].
   If no time zone is specified, the default time zone, which is implementation defined,
   is used.

**Return Data Type**

`DATETIME`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME(2008, 12, 25, 05, 30, 00) as datetime_ymdhms,
  DATETIME(TIMESTAMP "2008-12-25 05:30:00+00", "America/Los_Angeles") as datetime_tstz;

+---------------------+---------------------+
| datetime_ymdhms     | datetime_tstz       |
+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2008-12-25 05:30:00 | 2008-12-24 21:30:00 |
+---------------------+---------------------+
```

### EXTRACT

```sql
EXTRACT(part FROM datetime_expression)
```

**Description**

Returns a value that corresponds to the
specified `part` from a supplied `datetime_expression`.

Allowed `part` values are:

+ `NANOSECOND`
  (if the SQL engine supports it)
+ `MICROSECOND`
+ `MILLISECOND`
+ `SECOND`
+ `MINUTE`
+ `HOUR`
+ `DAYOFWEEK`: Returns values in the range [1,7] with Sunday as the first day of
   of the week.
+ `DAY`
+ `DAYOFYEAR`
+ `WEEK`: Returns the week number of the date in the range [0, 53].  Weeks begin
  with Sunday, and dates prior to the first Sunday of the year are in week 0.
+ `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`: Returns the week number of `datetime_expression` in the
  range [0, 53]. Weeks begin on `WEEKDAY`.
  `datetime`s prior to the first `WEEKDAY` of the year are in week 0. Valid
  values for `WEEKDAY` are `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`,
  `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, and `SATURDAY`.
+ `ISOWEEK`: Returns the [ISO 8601 week][ISO-8601-week]
  number of the `datetime_expression`. `ISOWEEK`s begin on Monday. Return values
  are in the range [1, 53]. The first `ISOWEEK` of each ISO year begins on the
  Monday before the first Thursday of the Gregorian calendar year.
+ `MONTH`
+ `QUARTER`
+ `YEAR`
+ `ISOYEAR`: Returns the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601]
  week-numbering year, which is the Gregorian calendar year containing the
  Thursday of the week to which `date_expression` belongs.
+ `DATE`
+ `TIME`

Returned values truncate lower order time periods. For example, when extracting
seconds, `EXTRACT` truncates the millisecond and microsecond values.

**Return Data Type**

`INT64`, except in the following cases:

+ If `part` is `DATE`, returns a `DATE` object.
+ If `part` is `TIME`, returns a `TIME` object.

**Examples**

In the following example, `EXTRACT` returns a value corresponding to the `HOUR`
time part.

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM DATETIME(2008, 12, 25, 15, 30, 00)) as hour;

+------------------+
| hour             |
+------------------+
| 15               |
+------------------+
```

In the following example, `EXTRACT` returns values corresponding to different
time parts from a column of datetimes.

```sql
WITH Datetimes AS (
  SELECT DATETIME '2005-01-03 12:34:56' AS datetime UNION ALL
  SELECT DATETIME '2007-12-31' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATETIME '2009-01-01' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATETIME '2009-12-31' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATETIME '2017-01-02' UNION ALL
  SELECT DATETIME '2017-05-26'
)
SELECT
  datetime,
  EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM datetime) AS isoyear,
  EXTRACT(ISOWEEK FROM datetime) AS isoweek,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM datetime) AS year,
  EXTRACT(WEEK FROM datetime) AS week
FROM Datetimes
ORDER BY datetime;

+---------------------+---------+---------+------+------+
| datetime            | isoyear | isoweek | year | week |
+---------------------+---------+---------+------+------+
| 2005-01-03 12:34:56 | 2005    | 1       | 2005 | 1    |
| 2007-12-31 00:00:00 | 2008    | 1       | 2007 | 52   |
| 2009-01-01 00:00:00 | 2009    | 1       | 2009 | 0    |
| 2009-12-31 00:00:00 | 2009    | 53      | 2009 | 52   |
| 2017-01-02 00:00:00 | 2017    | 1       | 2017 | 1    |
| 2017-05-26 00:00:00 | 2017    | 21      | 2017 | 21   |
+---------------------+---------+---------+------+------+
```

In the following example, `datetime_expression` falls on a Sunday. `EXTRACT`
calculates the first column using weeks that begin on Sunday, and it calculates
the second column using weeks that begin on Monday.

```sql
WITH table AS (SELECT DATETIME(TIMESTAMP "2017-11-05 00:00:00+00", "UTC") AS datetime)
SELECT
  datetime,
  EXTRACT(WEEK(SUNDAY) FROM datetime) AS week_sunday,
  EXTRACT(WEEK(MONDAY) FROM datetime) AS week_monday
FROM table;

+---------------------+-------------+---------------+
| datetime            | week_sunday | week_monday   |
+---------------------+-------------+---------------+
| 2017-11-05 00:00:00 | 45          | 44            |
+---------------------+-------------+---------------+
```

### DATETIME_ADD

```sql
DATETIME_ADD(datetime_expression, INTERVAL int64_expression part)
```

**Description**

Adds `int64_expression` units of `part` to the `DATETIME` object.

`DATETIME_ADD` supports the following values for `part`:

+ `NANOSECOND`
  (if the SQL engine supports it)
+ `MICROSECOND`
+ `MILLISECOND`
+ `SECOND`
+ `MINUTE`
+ `HOUR`
+ `DAY`
+ `WEEK`. Equivalent to 7 `DAY`s.
+ `MONTH`
+ `QUARTER`
+ `YEAR`

Special handling is required for MONTH, QUARTER, and YEAR parts when the
date is at (or near) the last day of the month. If the resulting month has fewer
days than the original DATETIME's day, then the result day is the last day of
the new month.

**Return Data Type**

`DATETIME`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00" as original_date,
  DATETIME_ADD(DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00", INTERVAL 10 MINUTE) as later;

+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| original_date               | later                  |
+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| 2008-12-25 15:30:00         | 2008-12-25 15:40:00    |
+-----------------------------+------------------------+
```

### DATETIME_SUB

```sql
DATETIME_SUB(datetime_expression, INTERVAL int64_expression part)
```

**Description**

Subtracts `int64_expression` units of `part` from the `DATETIME`.

`DATETIME_SUB` supports the following values for `part`:

+ `NANOSECOND`
  (if the SQL engine supports it)
+ `MICROSECOND`
+ `MILLISECOND`
+ `SECOND`
+ `MINUTE`
+ `HOUR`
+ `DAY`
+ `WEEK`. Equivalent to 7 `DAY`s.
+ `MONTH`
+ `QUARTER`
+ `YEAR`

Special handling is required for `MONTH`, `QUARTER`, and `YEAR` parts when the
date is at (or near) the last day of the month. If the resulting month has fewer
days than the original `DATETIME`'s day, then the result day is the last day of
the new month.

**Return Data Type**

`DATETIME`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00" as original_date,
  DATETIME_SUB(DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00", INTERVAL 10 MINUTE) as earlier;

+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| original_date               | earlier                |
+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| 2008-12-25 15:30:00         | 2008-12-25 15:20:00    |
+-----------------------------+------------------------+
```

### DATETIME_DIFF

```sql
DATETIME_DIFF(datetime_expression_a, datetime_expression_b, part)
```

**Description**

Returns the whole number of specified `part` intervals between two
`DATETIME` objects (`datetime_expression_a` - `datetime_expression_b`).
If the first `DATETIME` is earlier than the second one,
the output is negative. Throws an error if the computation overflows the
result type, such as if the difference in
nanoseconds
between the two `DATETIME` objects would overflow an
`INT64` value.

`DATETIME_DIFF` supports the following values for `part`:

+ `NANOSECOND`
  (if the SQL engine supports it)
+ `MICROSECOND`
+ `MILLISECOND`
+ `SECOND`
+ `MINUTE`
+ `HOUR`
+ `DAY`
+ `WEEK`: This date part begins on Sunday.
+ `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`: This date part begins on `WEEKDAY`. Valid values for
  `WEEKDAY` are `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`,
  `FRIDAY`, and `SATURDAY`.
+ `ISOWEEK`: Uses [ISO 8601 week][ISO-8601-week]
  boundaries. ISO weeks begin on Monday.
+ `MONTH`, except when the first two arguments are `TIMESTAMP` objects.
+ `QUARTER`
+ `YEAR`
+ `ISOYEAR`: Uses the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601]
  week-numbering year boundary. The ISO year boundary is the Monday of the
  first week whose Thursday belongs to the corresponding Gregorian calendar
  year.

**Return Data Type**

`INT64`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME "2010-07-07 10:20:00" as first_datetime,
  DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00" as second_datetime,
  DATETIME_DIFF(DATETIME "2010-07-07 10:20:00",
    DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00", DAY) as difference;

+----------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| first_datetime             | second_datetime        | difference             |
+----------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| 2010-07-07 10:20:00        | 2008-12-25 15:30:00    | 559                    |
+----------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
```

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME_DIFF(DATETIME '2017-10-15 00:00:00',
    DATETIME '2017-10-14 00:00:00', DAY) as days_diff,
  DATETIME_DIFF(DATETIME '2017-10-15 00:00:00',
    DATETIME '2017-10-14 00:00:00', WEEK) as weeks_diff;

+-----------+------------+
| days_diff | weeks_diff |
+-----------+------------+
| 1         | 1          |
+-----------+------------+
```

The example above shows the result of `DATETIME_DIFF` for two `DATETIME`s that
are 24 hours apart. `DATETIME_DIFF` with the part `WEEK` returns 1 because
`DATETIME_DIFF` counts the number of part boundaries in this range of
`DATETIME`s. Each `WEEK` begins on Sunday, so there is one part boundary between
Saturday, `2017-10-14 00:00:00` and Sunday, `2017-10-15 00:00:00`.

The following example shows the result of `DATETIME_DIFF` for two dates in
different years. `DATETIME_DIFF` with the date part `YEAR` returns 3 because it
counts the number of Gregorian calendar year boundaries between the two
`DATETIME`s. `DATETIME_DIFF` with the date part `ISOYEAR` returns 2 because the
second `DATETIME` belongs to the ISO year 2015. The first Thursday of the 2015
calendar year was 2015-01-01, so the ISO year 2015 begins on the preceding
Monday, 2014-12-29.

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME_DIFF('2017-12-30 00:00:00',
    '2014-12-30 00:00:00', YEAR) AS year_diff,
  DATETIME_DIFF('2017-12-30 00:00:00',
    '2014-12-30 00:00:00', ISOYEAR) AS isoyear_diff;

+-----------+--------------+
| year_diff | isoyear_diff |
+-----------+--------------+
| 3         | 2            |
+-----------+--------------+
```

The following example shows the result of `DATETIME_DIFF` for two days in
succession. The first date falls on a Monday and the second date falls on a
Sunday. `DATETIME_DIFF` with the date part `WEEK` returns 0 because this time
part uses weeks that begin on Sunday. `DATETIME_DIFF` with the date part
`WEEK(MONDAY)` returns 1. `DATETIME_DIFF` with the date part
`ISOWEEK` also returns 1 because ISO weeks begin on Monday.

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME_DIFF('2017-12-18', '2017-12-17', WEEK) AS week_diff,
  DATETIME_DIFF('2017-12-18', '2017-12-17', WEEK(MONDAY)) AS week_weekday_diff,
  DATETIME_DIFF('2017-12-18', '2017-12-17', ISOWEEK) AS isoweek_diff;

+-----------+-------------------+--------------+
| week_diff | week_weekday_diff | isoweek_diff |
+-----------+-------------------+--------------+
| 0         | 1                 | 1            |
+-----------+-------------------+--------------+
```

### DATETIME_TRUNC

```sql
DATETIME_TRUNC(datetime_expression, date_time_part)
```

**Description**

Truncates a `DATETIME` value to the granularity of `date_time_part`.
The `DATETIME` value is always rounded to the beginning of `date_time_part`,
which can be one of the following:

+ `NANOSECOND`: If used, nothing is truncated from the value.
+ `MICROSECOND`: The nearest lessor or equal microsecond.
+ `MILLISECOND`: The nearest lessor or equal millisecond.
+ `SECOND`: The nearest lessor or equal second.
+ `MINUTE`: The nearest lessor or equal minute.
+ `HOUR`: The nearest lessor or equal hour.
+ `DAY`: The day in the Gregorian calendar year that contains the
  `DATETIME` value.
+ `WEEK`: The first day of the week in the week that contains the
  `DATETIME` value. Weeks begin on Sundays. `WEEK` is equivalent to
  `WEEK(SUNDAY)`.
+ `WEEK(WEEKDAY)`: The first day of the week in the week that contains the
  `DATETIME` value. Weeks begin on `WEEKDAY`. `WEEKDAY` must be one of the
   following: `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`,
   or `SATURDAY`.
+ `ISOWEEK`: The first day of the [ISO 8601 week][ISO-8601-week] in the
  ISO week that contains the `DATETIME` value. The ISO week begins on
  Monday. The first ISO week of each ISO year contains the first Thursday of the
  corresponding Gregorian calendar year.
+ `MONTH`: The first day of the month in the month that contains the
  `DATETIME` value.
+ `QUARTER`: The first day of the quarter in the quarter that contains the
  `DATETIME` value.
+ `YEAR`: The first day of the year in the year that contains the
  `DATETIME` value.
+ `ISOYEAR`: The first day of the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601] week-numbering year
  in the ISO year that contains the `DATETIME` value. The ISO year is the
  Monday of the first week whose Thursday belongs to the corresponding
  Gregorian calendar year.

<!-- mdlint on -->

**Return Data Type**

`DATETIME`

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00" as original,
  DATETIME_TRUNC(DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00", DAY) as truncated;

+----------------------------+------------------------+
| original                   | truncated              |
+----------------------------+------------------------+
| 2008-12-25 15:30:00        | 2008-12-25 00:00:00    |
+----------------------------+------------------------+
```

In the following example, the original `DATETIME` falls on a Sunday. Because the
`part` is `WEEK(MONDAY)`, `DATE_TRUNC` returns the `DATETIME` for the
preceding Monday.

```sql
SELECT
 datetime AS original,
 DATETIME_TRUNC(datetime, WEEK(MONDAY)) AS truncated
FROM (SELECT DATETIME(TIMESTAMP "2017-11-05 00:00:00+00", "UTC") AS datetime);

+---------------------+---------------------+
| original            | truncated           |
+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2017-11-05 00:00:00 | 2017-10-30 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+---------------------+
```

In the following example, the original `datetime_expression` is in the Gregorian
calendar year 2015. However, `DATETIME_TRUNC` with the `ISOYEAR` date part
truncates the `datetime_expression` to the beginning of the ISO year, not the
Gregorian calendar year. The first Thursday of the 2015 calendar year was
2015-01-01, so the ISO year 2015 begins on the preceding Monday, 2014-12-29.
Therefore the ISO year boundary preceding the `datetime_expression`
2015-06-15 00:00:00 is 2014-12-29.

```sql
SELECT
  DATETIME_TRUNC('2015-06-15 00:00:00', ISOYEAR) AS isoyear_boundary,
  EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM DATETIME '2015-06-15 00:00:00') AS isoyear_number;

+---------------------+----------------+
| isoyear_boundary    | isoyear_number |
+---------------------+----------------+
| 2014-12-29 00:00:00 | 2015           |
+---------------------+----------------+
```

### FORMAT_DATETIME

```sql
FORMAT_DATETIME(format_string, datetime_expression)
```

**Description**

Formats a `DATETIME` object according to the specified `format_string`. See
[Supported Format Elements For DATETIME][datetime-format-elements]
for a list of format elements that this function supports.

**Return Data Type**

`STRING`

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATETIME("%c", DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00")
  AS formatted;

+--------------------------+
| formatted                |
+--------------------------+
| Thu Dec 25 15:30:00 2008 |
+--------------------------+
```

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATETIME("%b-%d-%Y", DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00")
  AS formatted;

+-------------+
| formatted   |
+-------------+
| Dec-25-2008 |
+-------------+
```

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATETIME("%b %Y", DATETIME "2008-12-25 15:30:00")
  AS formatted;

+-------------+
| formatted   |
+-------------+
| Dec 2008    |
+-------------+
```

### LAST_DAY

```sql
LAST_DAY(datetime_expression[, date_part])
```

**Description**

Returns the last day from a datetime expression that contains the date.
This is commonly used to return the last day of the month.

You can optionally specify the date part for which the last day is returned.
If this parameter is not used, the default value is `MONTH`.
`LAST_DAY` supports the following values for `date_part`:

+  `YEAR`
+  `QUARTER`
+  `MONTH`
+  `WEEK`. Equivalent to 7 `DAY`s.
+  `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`. `<WEEKDAY>` represents the starting day of the week.
   Valid values are `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`,
   `FRIDAY`, and `SATURDAY`.
+  `ISOWEEK`. Uses [ISO 8601][ISO-8601-week] week boundaries. ISO weeks begin
   on Monday.
+  `ISOYEAR`. Uses the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601] week-numbering year boundary.
   The ISO year boundary is the Monday of the first week whose Thursday belongs
   to the corresponding Gregorian calendar year.

**Return Data Type**

`DATE`

**Example**

These both return the last day of the month:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATETIME '2008-11-25', MONTH) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-30 |
+------------+
```

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATETIME '2008-11-25') AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-30 |
+------------+
```

This returns the last day of the year:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATETIME '2008-11-25 15:30:00', YEAR) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-12-31 |
+------------+
```

This returns the last day of the week for a week that starts on a Sunday:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATETIME '2008-11-10 15:30:00', WEEK(SUNDAY)) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-15 |
+------------+
```

This returns the last day of the week for a week that starts on a Monday:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATETIME '2008-11-10 15:30:00', WEEK(MONDAY)) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-16 |
+------------+
```

### PARSE_DATETIME

```sql
PARSE_DATETIME(format_string, datetime_string)
```
**Description**

Converts a [string representation of a datetime][datetime-format] to a
`DATETIME` object.

`format_string` contains the [format elements][datetime-format-elements]
that define how `datetime_string` is formatted. Each element in
`datetime_string` must have a corresponding element in `format_string`. The
location of each element in `format_string` must match the location of
each element in `datetime_string`.

```sql
-- This works because elements on both sides match.
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME("%a %b %e %I:%M:%S %Y", "Thu Dec 25 07:30:00 2008")

-- This doesn't work because the year element is in different locations.
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME("%a %b %e %Y %I:%M:%S", "Thu Dec 25 07:30:00 2008")

-- This doesn't work because one of the year elements is missing.
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME("%a %b %e %I:%M:%S", "Thu Dec 25 07:30:00 2008")

-- This works because %c can find all matching elements in datetime_string.
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME("%c", "Thu Dec 25 07:30:00 2008")
```

The format string fully supports most format elements, except for
`%g`, `%G`, `%j`, `%P`, `%u`, `%U`, `%V`, `%w`, and `%W`.

`PARSE_DATETIME` parses `string` according to the following rules:

+ **Unspecified fields.** Any unspecified field is initialized from
  `1970-01-01 00:00:00.0`. For example, if the year is unspecified then it
  defaults to `1970`.
+ **Case insensitivity.** Names, such as `Monday` and `February`,
  are case insensitive.
+ **Whitespace.** One or more consecutive white spaces in the format string
  matches zero or more consecutive white spaces in the
  `DATETIME` string. Leading and trailing
  white spaces in the `DATETIME` string are always
  allowed, even if they are not in the format string.
+ **Format precedence.** When two or more format elements have overlapping
  information, the last one generally overrides any earlier ones, with some
  exceptions. For example, both `%F` and `%Y` affect the year, so the earlier
  element overrides the later. See the descriptions
  of `%s`, `%C`, and `%y` in
  [Supported Format Elements For DATETIME][datetime-format-elements].
+ **Format divergence.** `%p` can be used with `am`, `AM`, `pm`, and `PM`.

**Return Data Type**

`DATETIME`

**Examples**

The following examples parse a `STRING` literal as a
`DATETIME`.

```sql
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', '1998-10-18 13:45:55') AS datetime;

+---------------------+
| datetime            |
+---------------------+
| 1998-10-18 13:45:55 |
+---------------------+
```

```sql
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', '8/30/2018 2:23:38 pm') AS datetime

+---------------------+
| datetime            |
+---------------------+
| 2018-08-30 14:23:38 |
+---------------------+
```

The following example parses a `STRING` literal
containing a date in a natural language format as a
`DATETIME`.

```sql
SELECT PARSE_DATETIME('%A, %B %e, %Y','Wednesday, December 19, 2018')
  AS datetime;

+---------------------+
| datetime            |
+---------------------+
| 2018-12-19 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+
```
