# Data types

This page provides an overview of all ZetaSQL
data types, including information about their value
domains. For
information on data type literals and constructors, see
[Lexical Structure and Syntax][lexical-literals].

## Data type properties

When storing and querying data, it is helpful to keep the following data type
properties in mind:

### Nullable data types

For nullable data types, `NULL` is a valid value. Currently, all existing
data types are nullable.

### Orderable data types

Expressions of orderable data types can be used in an `ORDER BY` clause.
Applies to all data types except for:

+ `PROTO`
+ `STRUCT`
+ `JSON`

#### Ordering NULLs 
<a id="orderable_nulls"></a>

In the context of the `ORDER BY` clause, `NULL`s are the minimum
possible value; that is, `NULL`s appear first in `ASC` sorts and last in
`DESC` sorts.

`NULL` values can be specified as the first or last values for a column
irrespective of `ASC` or `DESC` by using the `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`
modifiers respectively.

To learn more about using `ASC`, `DESC`, `NULLS FIRST` and `NULLS LAST`, see
the [`ORDER BY` clause][order-by-clause].

#### Ordering floating points 
<a id="orderable_floating_points"></a>

Floating point values are sorted in this order, from least to greatest:

  1. `NULL`
  2. `NaN` &mdash; All `NaN` values are considered equal when sorting.
  3. `-inf`
  4. Negative numbers
  5. 0 or -0 &mdash; All zero values are considered equal when sorting.
  6. Positive numbers
  7. `+inf`

#### Ordering arrays 
<a id="orderable_arrays"></a>

`ARRAY<T>` is orderable if its type, `T`, is orderable. Empty arrays are
sorted before non-empty arrays. Non-empty arrays are sorted
lexicographically by element. An array that is a strict prefix of another array
orders less than the longer array.

Lexicographical ordering for arrays first compares the elements of each array
from the first element to the last. If an element orders before a corresponding
element in another array, then the arrays are ordered accordingly. Subsequent
array elements are ignored.

For example:

```sql
WITH
  t AS (
    SELECT [1, 2] a UNION ALL
    SELECT [1, NULL] a UNION ALL
    SELECT [0, 1] UNION ALL
    SELECT [0, 1, 4] UNION ALL
    SELECT [0, 1, 5] UNION ALL
    SELECT [3] UNION ALL
    SELECT [] UNION ALL
    SELECT CAST(NULL AS ARRAY<INT64>)
  )
SELECT a FROM t ORDER BY a

+-----------+
| a         |
+-----------+
| NULL      |
| []        |
| [0, 1]    |
| [0, 1, 4] |
| [0, 1, 5] |
| [1, NULL] |
| [1, 2]    |
| [3]       |
+-----------+
```

### Groupable data types

Groupable data types can generally appear in an expression following `GROUP BY`,
`DISTINCT`, and `PARTITION BY`. However, `PARTITION BY` expressions cannot
include [floating point types][floating-point-types]. All data types are
supported except for:

+ `PROTO`
+ `JSON`

An ARRAY type is groupable if its element type is groupable. Two arrays are in
the same group if and only if one of the following statements is true:

+ The two arrays are both `NULL`.
+ The two arrays have the same number of elements and all corresponding
  elements are in the same groups.

A STRUCT type is groupable if its field types are groupable. Two structs
are in the same group if and only if one of the following statements is true:

+ The two structs are both `NULL`.
+ All corresponding field values between the structs are in the same groups.

Special floating point values are grouped in the following way, including
both grouping done by a `GROUP BY` clause and grouping done by the
`DISTINCT` keyword:

  * `NULL`
  * `NaN` &mdash; All `NaN` values are considered equal when grouping.
  * `-inf`
  * 0 or -0 &mdash; All zero values are considered equal when grouping.
  * `+inf`

### Comparable data types

Values of the same comparable data type can be compared to each other.
All data types are supported except for:

+ `PROTO`
+ `JSON`

Notes:

+ Equality comparisons for `ARRAY` data types are supported as long as the
  element types are the same, and the element types are comparable. Less than
  and greater than comparisons are not supported.
+ Equality comparisons for `STRUCT`s are supported field by field, in
  field order. Field names are ignored. Less than and greater than comparisons
  are not supported.
+ All types that support comparisons can be used in a `JOIN` condition.
 See [JOIN Types][join-types] for an explanation of join conditions.

### Collatable data types

Collatable data types support collation, which determines how to sort and
compare strings. These data types support collation:

+ `STRING`
+ `STRING` fields in a `STRUCT`
+ `STRING` elements in an `ARRAY`

The maximum size of a  column value is 10MiB, which applies to
scalar and array types.

## Array type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>ARRAY</code></td>
<td>Ordered list of zero or more elements of any non-ARRAY type.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

An ARRAY is an ordered list of zero or more elements of non-ARRAY values.
Elements in an array must share the same type.

ARRAYs of ARRAYs are not allowed. Queries that would produce an ARRAY of
ARRAYs will return an error. Instead, a STRUCT must be inserted between the
ARRAYs using the `SELECT AS STRUCT` construct.

To learn more about the literal representation of an array type,
see [Array literals][array-literals].

### NULLs and the ARRAY type 
<a id="array_nulls"></a>

An empty ARRAY and a `NULL` ARRAY are two distinct values. ARRAYs can contain
`NULL` elements.

### Declaring an ARRAY type

```
ARRAY<T>
```

ARRAY types are declared using the angle brackets (`<` and `>`). The type
of the elements of an ARRAY can be arbitrarily complex with the exception that
an ARRAY cannot directly contain another ARRAY.

**Examples**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type Declaration</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<code>
ARRAY&lt;INT64&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td>Simple ARRAY of 64-bit integers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space:nowrap">
<code>
ARRAY&lt;STRUCT&lt;INT64, INT64&gt;&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td>An ARRAY of STRUCTs, each of which contains two 64-bit integers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space:nowrap">
<code>
ARRAY&lt;ARRAY&lt;INT64&gt;&gt;
</code><br/>
(not supported)
</td>
<td>This is an <strong>invalid</strong> type declaration which is included here
just in case you came looking for how to create a multi-level ARRAY. ARRAYs
cannot contain ARRAYs directly. Instead see the next example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space:nowrap">
<code>
ARRAY&lt;STRUCT&lt;ARRAY&lt;INT64&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td>An ARRAY of ARRAYS of 64-bit integers. Notice that there is a STRUCT between
the two ARRAYs because ARRAYs cannot hold other ARRAYs directly.</td>
</tr>
<tbody>
</table>

### Constructing an ARRAY 
<a id="constructing_an_array"></a>

You can construct an ARRAY using array literals or array functions, and perform
other tasks with arrays, such as accessing array elements and
converting arrays to strings.

To learn more about constructing and using arrays, see [Work with
arrays][working-with-arrays].

## Boolean type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>BOOL</code></td>
<td>Boolean values are represented by the keywords <code>TRUE</code> and
<code>FALSE</code> (case-insensitive).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Boolean values are sorted in this order, from least to greatest:

  1. `NULL`
  1. `FALSE`
  1. `TRUE`

## Bytes type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>BYTES</code></td>
<td>Variable-length binary data.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

STRING and BYTES are separate types that cannot be used interchangeably. Most
functions on STRING are also defined on BYTES. The BYTES version operates on raw
bytes rather than Unicode characters. Casts between STRING and BYTES enforce
that the bytes are encoded using UTF-8.

To learn more about the literal representation of a bytes type,
see [Bytes literals][bytes-literals].

## Date type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Range</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>DATE</code></td>
<td>0001-01-01 to 9999-12-31.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The DATE type represents a logical calendar date, independent of time zone. A
DATE value does not represent a specific 24-hour time period. Rather, a given
DATE value represents a different 24-hour period when interpreted in different
time zones, and may represent a shorter or longer day during Daylight Savings
Time transitions.
To represent an absolute point in time,
use a [timestamp][timestamp-type].

##### Canonical format

```
'YYYY-[M]M-[D]D'
```

+ `YYYY`: Four-digit year
+ `[M]M`: One or two digit month
+ `[D]D`: One or two digit day

To learn more about the literal representation of a date type,
see [Date literals][date-literals].

## Datetime type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Range</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>DATETIME</code></td>
<td>
    
        0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999999<br/>
        <hr/>
        0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999<br/>
    
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A DATETIME value represents a date and time, as they might be displayed
on a watch, independent of time zone.
It includes the year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
and subsecond.
The range of subsecond precision is determined by the SQL engine.
To represent an absolute point in time,
use a [timestamp][timestamp-type].

##### Canonical format

```
YYYY-[M]M-[D]D[( |T)[H]H:[M]M:[S]S[.F]]
```

+ <code>YYYY</code>: Four-digit year
+ <code>[M]M</code>: One or two digit month
+ <code>[D]D</code>: One or two digit day
+ <code>( |T)</code>: A space or a `T` separator
+ <code>[H]H</code>: One or two digit hour (valid values from 00 to 23)
+ <code>[M]M</code>: One or two digit minutes (valid values from 00 to 59)
+ <code>[S]S</code>: One or two digit seconds (valid values from 00 to 59)
+ <code>[.F]</code>: Up to nine fractional
  digits (nanosecond precision)

To learn more about the literal representation of a datetime type,
see [Datetime literals][datetime-literals].

## Enum type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>ENUM</code></td>
<td>Named type that maps STRING constants to INT32 constants.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

An ENUM is a named type that enumerates a list of possible values, each of which
has:

+ An integer value. Integers are used for comparison and ordering ENUM values.
There is no requirement that these integers start at zero or that they be
contiguous.
+ A string value. Strings are case sensitive.
+ Optional alias values. One or more additional string values that act as
aliases.

Enum values are referenced using their integer value or their string value.
You reference an ENUM type, such as when using CAST, by using its fully
qualified name.

You cannot create new ENUM types using ZetaSQL.

To learn more about the literal representation of an enum type,
see [Enum literals][enum-literals].

## Interval type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Range</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>INTERVAL</code></td>
<td>
-10000-0 -3660000 -87840000:0:0 to 10000-0 3660000 87840000:0:0
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

An INTERVAL object represents duration or amount of time.
Interval is composed of three independent parts:

+ `[sign]Y-M`: Years and Months
+ `[sign]D`: Days
+ `[sign]H:M:S.F`: Hours, Minutes, Seconds and
  Subseconds. The
  range of subsecond precision is determined by the SQL engine.

##### Canonical format

```
[sign]Y-M [sign]D [sign]H:M:S[.F]
```

+ <code>Y</code>: Year
+ <code>M</code>: Month
+ <code>D</code>: Day
+ <code>H</code>: Hour
+ <code>M</code>: Minute
+ <code>S</code>: Second
+ <code>[.F]</code>: Up to nine fractional
  digits (nanosecond precision)

To learn more about the literal representation of an interval type,
see [Interval literals][interval-literals].

## JSON type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>JSON</code></td>
<td>Represents JSON, a lightweight data-interchange format.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Expect these canonicalization behaviors when creating a value of `JSON` type:

+  Booleans, strings, and nulls are preserved exactly.
+  Whitespace characters are not preserved.
+  A JSON value can store integers in the range of
   -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (minimal signed 64-bit integer) to
   18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (maximal unsigned 64-bit integer) and
   floating point numbers within a domain of
   `DOUBLE`.
+  The order of elements in an array is preserved exactly.
+  The order of the members of an object is not guaranteed or preserved.
+  If an object has duplicate keys, the first key that is found is preserved.
+  The format of the original string representation of a JSON number may not be
   preserved.

To learn more about the literal representation of a JSON type,
see [JSON literals][json-literals].

## Numeric types

Numeric types include the following types:

* `INT32`
* `UINT32`
* `INT64`
* `UINT64`
* `NUMERIC` with alias `DECIMAL`
* `BIGNUMERIC` with alias `BIGDECIMAL`
* `FLOAT`
* `DOUBLE`

### Integer types 
<a id="integer_types"></a>

Integers are numeric values that do not have fractional components.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Range</th>

</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td><code>INT32</code></td>
<td>-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</td>
</tr>

<tr>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>UINT64</code></td>
<td>0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

To learn more about the literal representation of an integer type,
see [Integer literals][integer-literals].

### Decimal types 
<a id="decimal_types"></a>

Decimal type values are numeric values with fixed decimal precision and scale.
Precision is the number of digits that the number contains. Scale is
how many of these digits appear after the decimal point.

This type can represent decimal fractions exactly, and is suitable for financial
calculations.

<table>

`DECIMAL` is an alias for `NUMERIC`.
`BIGDECIMAL` is an alias for `BIGNUMERIC`.

To learn more about the literal representation of a `BIGDECIMAL` type,
see [`BIGNUMERIC` literals][bignumeric-literals].

### Floating point types 
<a id="floating_point_types"></a>

Floating point values are approximate numeric values with fractional components.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td><code>FLOAT</code></td>
<td>Single precision (approximate) numeric values.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>DOUBLE</code></td>
<td>Double precision (approximate) numeric values.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

see [Floating point literals][floating-point-literals].

#### Floating point semantics

When working with floating point numbers, there are special non-numeric values
that need to be considered: `NaN` and `+/-inf`

Arithmetic operators provide standard IEEE-754 behavior for all finite input
values that produce finite output and for all operations for which at least one
input is non-finite.

Function calls and operators return an overflow error if the input is finite
but the output would be non-finite. If the input contains non-finite values, the
output can be non-finite. In general functions do not introduce `NaN`s or
`+/-inf`. However, specific functions like `IEEE_DIVIDE` can return non-finite
values on finite input. All such cases are noted explicitly in
[Mathematical functions][mathematical-functions].

Floating point values are approximations.

+ The binary format used to represent floating point values can only represent
  a subset of the numbers between the most positive number and most
  negative number in the value range. This enables efficient handling of a
  much larger range than would be possible otherwise.
  Numbers that are not exactly representable are approximated by utilizing a
  close value instead. For example, `0.1` cannot be represented as an integer
  scaled by a power of `2`. When this value is displayed as a string, it is
  rounded to a limited number of digits, and the value approximating `0.1`
  might appear as `"0.1"`, hiding the fact that the value is not precise.
  In other situations, the approximation can be visible.
+ Summation of floating point values might produce surprising results because
  of [limited precision][floating-point-accuracy]. For example,
  `(1e30 + 1e-20) - 1e30 = 0`, while `(1e30 - 1e30) + 1e-20 = 1e-20`. This is
  because the floating point value does not have enough precision to
  represent `(1e30 + 1e-20)`, and the result is rounded to `1e30`.
  This example also shows that the result of the `SUM` aggregate function of
  floating points values depends on the order in which the values are
  accumulated. In general, this order is not deterministic and therefore the
  result is not deterministic. Thus, the resulting `SUM` of
  floating point values might not be deterministic and two executions of the
  same query on the same tables might produce different results.
+ If the above points are concerning, use a
  [decimal type][decimal-types] instead.

## Protocol buffer type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>PROTO</code></td>
<td>An instance of protocol buffer.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Protocol buffers provide structured data types with a defined serialization
format and cross-language support libraries. Protocol buffer message types can
contain optional, required or repeated fields, including nested messages. See
the
[Protocol Buffers Developer Guide][protocol-buffers-dev-guide] for more detail.

Protocol buffer message types behave similarly to STRUCT types, and support
similar operations like reading field values by name. Protocol buffer types are
always named types, and can be referred to by their fully-qualified protocol
buffer name (i.e. `package.ProtoName`). Protocol buffers support some additional
behavior beyond STRUCTs, like default field values, and checking for the
presence of optional fields.

Protocol buffer ENUM types are also available and can be referenced using the
fully-qualified ENUM type name.

See [Work with protocol buffers][protocol-buffers]
for more information.

### Constructing a PROTO 
<a id="constructing_a_proto"></a>

You can construct a PROTO using the [`NEW`][new-operator] operator or the
[`SELECT AS typename`][select-as-typename] statement. To learn more about
constructing, configuring, and using PROTOs in ZetaSQL, see [Work with
protocol buffers][protocol-buffers].

### Limited comparisons for PROTO

No direct comparison of PROTO values is supported. There are a couple possible
workarounds:

+ The most accurate way to compare PROTOs is to do a pair-wise comparison
  between the fields of the PROTOs. This can also be used to `GROUP BY` or
  `ORDER BY` PROTO fields.
+ To get a simple approximation comparison, cast PROTO to
  STRING. This applies lexicographical ordering for numeric fields.

## String type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>STRING</code></td>
<td>Variable-length character (Unicode) data.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Input STRING values must be UTF-8 encoded and output STRING values will be UTF-8
encoded. Alternate encodings like CESU-8 and Modified UTF-8 are not treated as
valid UTF-8.

All functions and operators that act on STRING values operate on Unicode
characters rather than bytes. For example, functions like `SUBSTR` and `LENGTH`
applied to STRING input count the number of characters, not bytes.

Each Unicode character has a numeric value called a code point assigned to it.
Lower code points are assigned to lower characters. When characters are
compared, the code points determine which characters are less than or greater
than other characters.

Most functions on STRING are also defined on BYTES. The BYTES version operates
on raw bytes rather than Unicode characters. STRING and BYTES are separate types
that cannot be used interchangeably. There is no implicit casting in either
direction. Explicit casting between STRING and BYTES does UTF-8 encoding and
decoding. Casting BYTES to STRING returns an error if the bytes are not
valid UTF-8.

To learn more about the literal representation of a string type,
see [String literals][string-literals].

## Struct type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT</code></td>
<td>Container of ordered fields each with a type (required) and field name
(optional).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To learn more about the literal representation of a struct type,
see [Struct literals][struct-literals].

### Declaring a STRUCT type

```
STRUCT<T>
```

STRUCT types are declared using the angle brackets (`<` and `>`). The type of
the elements of a STRUCT can be arbitrarily complex.

**Examples**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type Declaration</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<code>
STRUCT&lt;INT64&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td>Simple STRUCT with a single unnamed 64-bit integer field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space:nowrap">
<code>
STRUCT&lt;x STRUCT&lt;y INT64, z INT64&gt;&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td>A STRUCT with a nested STRUCT named <code>x</code> inside it. The STRUCT
<code>x</code> has two fields, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, both of which
are 64-bit integers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space:nowrap">
<code>
STRUCT&lt;inner_array ARRAY&lt;INT64&gt;&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td>A STRUCT containing an ARRAY named <code>inner_array</code> that holds
64-bit integer elements.</td>
</tr>
<tbody>
</table>

### Constructing a STRUCT 
<a id="constructing_a_struct"></a>

#### Tuple syntax

```
(expr1, expr2 [, ... ])
```

The output type is an anonymous STRUCT type with anonymous fields with types
matching the types of the input expressions. There must be at least two
expressions specified. Otherwise this syntax is indistinguishable from an
expression wrapped with parentheses.

**Examples**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Syntax</th>
<th>Output Type</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="white-space:nowrap"><code>(x, x+y)</code></td>
<td style="white-space:nowrap"><code>STRUCT&lt;?,?&gt;</code></td>
<td>If column names are used (unquoted strings), the STRUCT field data type is
derived from the column data type. <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are
columns, so the data types of the STRUCT fields are derived from the column
types and the output type of the addition operator.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This syntax can also be used with STRUCT comparison for comparison expressions
using multi-part keys, e.g. in a `WHERE` clause:

```
WHERE (Key1,Key2) IN ( (12,34), (56,78) )
```

#### Typeless struct syntax

```
STRUCT( expr1 [AS field_name] [, ... ])
```

Duplicate field names are allowed. Fields without names are considered anonymous
fields and cannot be referenced by name. STRUCT values can be `NULL`, or can
have `NULL` field values.

**Examples**

<table>

<tr>
<th>Syntax</th>
<th>Output Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT(1,2,3)</code></td>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;int64,int64,int64&gt;</code></td>

#### Typed struct syntax

```
STRUCT<[field_name] field_type, ...>( expr1 [, ... ])
```

Typed syntax allows constructing STRUCTs with an explicit STRUCT data type. The
output type is exactly the `field_type` provided. The input expression is
coerced to `field_type` if the two types are not the same, and an error is
produced if the types are not compatible. `AS alias` is not allowed on the input
expressions. The number of expressions must match the number of fields in the
type, and the expression types must be coercible or literal-coercible to the
field types.

**Examples**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Syntax</th>
<th>Output Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;int64&gt;(5)</code></td>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;int64&gt;</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;date&gt;("2011-05-05")</code></td>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;date&gt;</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;x int64, y string&gt;(1, t.str_col)</code></td>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;x int64, y string&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;int64&gt;(int_col)</code></td>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;int64&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>STRUCT&lt;x int64&gt;(5 AS x)</code></td>
<td>Error - Typed syntax does not allow <code>AS</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Limited comparisons for STRUCT

STRUCTs can be directly compared using equality operators:

  * Equal (`=`)
  * Not Equal (`!=` or `<>`)
  * [`NOT`] `IN`

Notice, though, that these direct equality comparisons compare the fields of
the STRUCT pairwise in ordinal order ignoring any field names. If instead you
want to compare identically named fields of a STRUCT, you can compare the
individual fields directly.

## Time type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Range</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>TIME</code></td>

    <td>
        00:00:00 to 23:59:59.999999999<br/>

A TIME value represents a time of day, as might be displayed on a clock,
independent of a specific date and time zone.
The range of
subsecond precision is determined by the
SQL engine. To represent
an absolute point in time, use a [timestamp][timestamp-type].

##### Canonical format

```
[H]H:[M]M:[S]S[.DDDDDD|.F]
```

+ <code>[H]H</code>: One or two digit hour (valid values from 00 to 23)
+ <code>[M]M</code>: One or two digit minutes (valid values from 00 to 59)
+ <code>[S]S</code>: One or two digit seconds (valid values from 00 to 59)
+ <code>[.F]</code>: Up to nine fractional
  digits (nanosecond precision)

To learn more about the literal representation of a time type,
see [Time literals][time-literals].

## Timestamp type

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Range</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>TIMESTAMP</code></td>

    <td>
      0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999999 UTC<br/>
      <hr/>
      0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999 UTC<br/>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A TIMESTAMP value represents an absolute point in time,
independent of any time zone or convention such as Daylight Savings Time,
with
microsecond or nanosecond
precision.
The range of subsecond precision is determined by the SQL engine.

A TIMESTAMP is typically represented internally as the number of elapsed
nanoseconds or
microseconds
since a fixed initial point in time.

Note that a TIMESTAMP itself does not have a time zone; it represents the same
instant in time globally. However, the _display_ of a timestamp for human
readability usually includes a date, a time, and a time zone, in an
implementation-dependent format. For example, the displayed values "2020-01-01
00:00:00 UTC", "2019-12-31 19:00:00 America/New_York", and "2020-01-01 05:30:00
Asia/Kolkata" all represent the same instant in time and therefore represent the
same TIMESTAMP value.

+  To represent a date as it might appear on a calendar (a civil date),
   use a [DATE][date-type] value.
+  To represent a time as it might appear on a clock (a civil time),
   use a [TIME][time-type] value.
+  To represent a date and time as they might appear on a watch,
   use a [DATETIME][datetime-type] value.

##### Canonical format for TIMESTAMP literals

The canonical format for a TIMESTAMP literal has the following parts:

```
{
  civil_date_time [time_zone] |
  civil_date_time[time_zone_offset] |
  civil_date_time[utc_time_zone]
}

civil_date_time:
    YYYY-[M]M-[D]D[( |T)[H]H:[M]M:[S]S[.F]]
```

+   <code>YYYY</code>: Four-digit year
+   <code>[M]M</code>: One or two digit month
+   <code>[D]D</code>: One or two digit day
+   <code>( |T)</code>: A space or a `T` separator
+   <code>[H]H</code>: One or two digit hour (valid values from 00 to 23)
+   <code>[M]M</code>: One or two digit minutes (valid values from 00 to 59)
+   <code>[S]S</code>: One or two digit seconds (valid values from 00 to 59)
+   <code>[.F]</code>: Up to nine fractional
    digits (nanosecond precision)
+   <code>[time_zone]</code>: String representing the time zone. When a time
    zone is not explicitly specified, the default time zone,
    which is implementation defined, is used. For details, see <a href="#time_zones">time
    zones</a>.
+   <code>[time_zone_offset]</code>: String representing the offset from the
    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone. For details, see
    <a href="#time_zones">time zones</a>.
+   <code>[utc_time_zone]</code>: String representing the Coordinated Universal
    Time (UTC), usually the letter `Z`. For details, see
    <a href="#time_zones">time zones</a>.

see [Timestamp literals][timestamp-literals].

### Time zones 
<a id="time_zones"></a>

A time zone is used when converting from a civil date or time (as might appear
on a calendar or clock) to a timestamp (an absolute time), or vice versa. This
includes the operation of parsing a string containing a civil date and time like
"2020-01-01 00:00:00" and converting it to a timestamp. The resulting timestamp
value itself does not store a specific time zone, because it represents one
instant in time globally.

Time zones are represented by strings in one of these canonical formats:

+ Offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), or the letter `Z` for UTC
+ Time zone name from the [tz database][tz-database]{: class=external target=_blank }

The following timestamps are identical because the time zone offset
for `America/Los_Angeles` is `-08` for the specified date and time.

```sql
SELECT UNIX_MILLIS(TIMESTAMP '2008-12-25 15:30:00 America/Los_Angeles') AS millis;
```

```sql
SELECT UNIX_MILLIS(TIMESTAMP '2008-12-25 15:30:00-08:00') AS millis;
```

#### Offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

```
(+|-)H[H][:M[M]]
Z
```

**Examples**

```
-08:00
-8:15
+3:00
+07:30
-7
Z
```

When using this format, no space is allowed between the time zone and the rest
of the timestamp.

```
2014-09-27 12:30:00.45-8:00
2014-09-27T12:30:00.45Z
```

#### Time zone name

```
continent/[region/]city
```

Time zone names are from the [tz database][tz-database]{: class=external target=_blank }.
For a less comprehensive but simpler reference, see the
[List of tz database time zones][tz-database-list]{: class=external target=_blank }
on Wikipedia.

**Examples**

```
America/Los_Angeles
America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires
```

When using a time zone name, a space is required between the name and the rest
of the timestamp:

```
2014-09-27 12:30:00.45 America/Los_Angeles
```

Note that not all time zone names are interchangeable even if they do happen to
report the same time during a given part of the year. For example,
`America/Los_Angeles` reports the same time as `UTC-7:00` during Daylight
Savings Time, but reports the same time as `UTC-8:00` outside of Daylight
Savings Time.

If a time zone is not specified, the default time zone value is used.

#### Leap seconds

A timestamp is simply an offset from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, assuming there are
exactly 60 seconds per minute. Leap seconds are not represented as part of a
stored timestamp.

If the input contains values that use ":60" in the seconds field to represent a
leap second, that leap second is not preserved when converting to a timestamp
value. Instead that value is interpreted as a timestamp with ":00" in the
seconds field of the following minute.

Leap seconds do not affect timestamp computations. All timestamp computations
are done using Unix-style timestamps, which do not reflect leap seconds. Leap
seconds are only observable through functions that measure real-world time. In
these functions, it is possible for a timestamp second to be skipped or repeated
when there is a leap second.
