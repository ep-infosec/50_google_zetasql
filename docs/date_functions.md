# Date functions

ZetaSQL supports the following `DATE` functions.

### CURRENT_DATE

```sql
CURRENT_DATE([time_zone])
```

**Description**

Returns the current date as of the specified or default time zone. Parentheses
are optional when called with no
arguments.

 This function supports an optional
`time_zone` parameter. This parameter is a string representing the time zone to
use. If no time zone is specified, the default time zone,
which is implementation defined, is used. See
[Time zone definitions][date-functions-link-to-timezone-definitions]
for information on how to specify a time zone.

If the `time_zone` parameter evaluates to `NULL`, this function returns `NULL`.

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Example**

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS the_date;

+--------------+
| the_date     |
+--------------+
| 2016-12-25   |
+--------------+
```

When a column named `current_date` is present, the column name and the function
call without parentheses are ambiguous. To ensure the function call, add
parentheses; to ensure the column name, qualify it with its
[range variable][date-functions-link-to-range-variables]. For example, the
following query will select the function in the `the_date` column and the table
column in the `current_date` column.

```sql
WITH t AS (SELECT 'column value' AS `current_date`)
SELECT current_date() AS the_date, t.current_date FROM t;

+------------+--------------+
| the_date   | current_date |
+------------+--------------+
| 2016-12-25 | column value |
+------------+--------------+
```

### EXTRACT

```sql
EXTRACT(part FROM date_expression)
```

**Description**

Returns the value corresponding to the specified date part. The `part` must
be one of:

+   `DAYOFWEEK`: Returns values in the range [1,7] with Sunday as the first day
    of the week.
+   `DAY`
+   `DAYOFYEAR`
+ `WEEK`: Returns the week number of the date in the range [0, 53]. Weeks begin
  with Sunday, and dates prior to the first Sunday of the year are in week 0.
+ `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`: Returns the week number of the date in the range [0, 53].
  Weeks begin on `WEEKDAY`. Dates prior to
  the first `WEEKDAY` of the year are in week 0. Valid values for `WEEKDAY` are
  `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, and
  `SATURDAY`.
+ `ISOWEEK`: Returns the [ISO 8601 week][ISO-8601-week]
  number of the `date_expression`. `ISOWEEK`s begin on Monday. Return values
  are in the range [1, 53]. The first `ISOWEEK` of each ISO year begins on the
  Monday before the first Thursday of the Gregorian calendar year.
+   `MONTH`
+   `QUARTER`: Returns values in the range [1,4].
+   `YEAR`
+   `ISOYEAR`: Returns the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601]
    week-numbering year, which is the Gregorian calendar year containing the
    Thursday of the week to which `date_expression` belongs.

**Return Data Type**

INT64

**Examples**

In the following example, `EXTRACT` returns a value corresponding to the `DAY`
date part.

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM DATE '2013-12-25') AS the_day;

+---------+
| the_day |
+---------+
| 25      |
+---------+
```

In the following example, `EXTRACT` returns values corresponding to different
date parts from a column of dates near the end of the year.

```sql
SELECT
  date,
  EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM date) AS isoyear,
  EXTRACT(ISOWEEK FROM date) AS isoweek,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
  EXTRACT(WEEK FROM date) AS week
FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY('2015-12-23', '2016-01-09')) AS date
ORDER BY date;
+------------+---------+---------+------+------+
| date       | isoyear | isoweek | year | week |
+------------+---------+---------+------+------+
| 2015-12-23 | 2015    | 52      | 2015 | 51   |
| 2015-12-24 | 2015    | 52      | 2015 | 51   |
| 2015-12-25 | 2015    | 52      | 2015 | 51   |
| 2015-12-26 | 2015    | 52      | 2015 | 51   |
| 2015-12-27 | 2015    | 52      | 2015 | 52   |
| 2015-12-28 | 2015    | 53      | 2015 | 52   |
| 2015-12-29 | 2015    | 53      | 2015 | 52   |
| 2015-12-30 | 2015    | 53      | 2015 | 52   |
| 2015-12-31 | 2015    | 53      | 2015 | 52   |
| 2016-01-01 | 2015    | 53      | 2016 | 0    |
| 2016-01-02 | 2015    | 53      | 2016 | 0    |
| 2016-01-03 | 2015    | 53      | 2016 | 1    |
| 2016-01-04 | 2016    | 1       | 2016 | 1    |
| 2016-01-05 | 2016    | 1       | 2016 | 1    |
| 2016-01-06 | 2016    | 1       | 2016 | 1    |
| 2016-01-07 | 2016    | 1       | 2016 | 1    |
| 2016-01-08 | 2016    | 1       | 2016 | 1    |
| 2016-01-09 | 2016    | 1       | 2016 | 1    |
+------------+---------+---------+------+------+
```

In the following example, `date_expression` falls on a Sunday. `EXTRACT`
calculates the first column using weeks that begin on Sunday, and it calculates
the second column using weeks that begin on Monday.

```sql
WITH table AS (SELECT DATE('2017-11-05') AS date)
SELECT
  date,
  EXTRACT(WEEK(SUNDAY) FROM date) AS week_sunday,
  EXTRACT(WEEK(MONDAY) FROM date) AS week_monday FROM table;

+------------+-------------+-------------+
| date       | week_sunday | week_monday |
+------------+-------------+-------------+
| 2017-11-05 | 45          | 44          |
+------------+-------------+-------------+
```

### DATE

```sql
1. DATE(year, month, day)
2. DATE(timestamp_expression[, time_zone])
3. DATE(datetime_expression)
```

**Description**

1. Constructs a DATE from INT64 values representing
   the year, month, and day.
2. Extracts the DATE from a TIMESTAMP expression. It supports an
   optional parameter to [specify a time zone][date-functions-link-to-timezone-definitions]. If no
   time zone is specified, the default time zone, which is implementation defined, is used.
3. Extracts the DATE from a DATETIME expression.

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(2016, 12, 25) AS date_ymd,
  DATE(DATETIME "2016-12-25 23:59:59") AS date_dt,
  DATE(TIMESTAMP "2016-12-25 05:30:00+07", "America/Los_Angeles") AS date_tstz;

+------------+------------+------------+
| date_ymd   | date_dt    | date_tstz  |
+------------+------------+------------+
| 2016-12-25 | 2016-12-25 | 2016-12-24 |
+------------+------------+------------+
```

### DATE_ADD

```sql
DATE_ADD(date_expression, INTERVAL int64_expression date_part)
```

**Description**

Adds a specified time interval to a DATE.

`DATE_ADD` supports the following `date_part` values:

+  `DAY`
+  `WEEK`. Equivalent to 7 `DAY`s.
+  `MONTH`
+  `QUARTER`
+  `YEAR`

Special handling is required for MONTH, QUARTER, and YEAR parts when
the date is at (or near) the last day of the month. If the resulting
month has fewer days than the original date's day, then the resulting
date is the last date of that month.

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Example**

```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(DATE "2008-12-25", INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS five_days_later;

+--------------------+
| five_days_later    |
+--------------------+
| 2008-12-30         |
+--------------------+
```

### DATE_SUB

```sql
DATE_SUB(date_expression, INTERVAL int64_expression date_part)
```

**Description**

Subtracts a specified time interval from a DATE.

`DATE_SUB` supports the following `date_part` values:

+  `DAY`
+  `WEEK`. Equivalent to 7 `DAY`s.
+  `MONTH`
+  `QUARTER`
+  `YEAR`

Special handling is required for MONTH, QUARTER, and YEAR parts when
the date is at (or near) the last day of the month. If the resulting
month has fewer days than the original date's day, then the resulting
date is the last date of that month.

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Example**

```sql
SELECT DATE_SUB(DATE "2008-12-25", INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS five_days_ago;

+---------------+
| five_days_ago |
+---------------+
| 2008-12-20    |
+---------------+
```

### DATE_DIFF

```sql
DATE_DIFF(date_expression_a, date_expression_b, date_part)
```

**Description**

Returns the whole number of specified `date_part` intervals between two
`DATE` objects (`date_expression_a` - `date_expression_b`).
If the first `DATE` is earlier than the second one,
the output is negative.

`DATE_DIFF` supports the following `date_part` values:

+  `DAY`
+  `WEEK` This date part begins on Sunday.
+  `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`: This date part begins on `WEEKDAY`. Valid values for
   `WEEKDAY` are `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`,
   `FRIDAY`, and `SATURDAY`.
+  `ISOWEEK`: Uses [ISO 8601 week][ISO-8601-week]
   boundaries. ISO weeks begin on Monday.
+  `MONTH`, except when the first two arguments are `TIMESTAMP` objects.
+  `QUARTER`
+  `YEAR`
+  `ISOYEAR`: Uses the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601]
    week-numbering year boundary. The ISO year boundary is the Monday of the
    first week whose Thursday belongs to the corresponding Gregorian calendar
    year.

**Return Data Type**

INT64

**Example**

```sql
SELECT DATE_DIFF(DATE '2010-07-07', DATE '2008-12-25', DAY) AS days_diff;

+-----------+
| days_diff |
+-----------+
| 559       |
+-----------+
```

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_DIFF(DATE '2017-10-15', DATE '2017-10-14', DAY) AS days_diff,
  DATE_DIFF(DATE '2017-10-15', DATE '2017-10-14', WEEK) AS weeks_diff;

+-----------+------------+
| days_diff | weeks_diff |
+-----------+------------+
| 1         | 1          |
+-----------+------------+
```

The example above shows the result of `DATE_DIFF` for two days in succession.
`DATE_DIFF` with the date part `WEEK` returns 1 because `DATE_DIFF` counts the
number of date part boundaries in this range of dates. Each `WEEK` begins on
Sunday, so there is one date part boundary between Saturday, 2017-10-14
and Sunday, 2017-10-15.

The following example shows the result of `DATE_DIFF` for two dates in different
years. `DATE_DIFF` with the date part `YEAR` returns 3 because it counts the
number of Gregorian calendar year boundaries between the two dates. `DATE_DIFF`
with the date part `ISOYEAR` returns 2 because the second date belongs to the
ISO year 2015. The first Thursday of the 2015 calendar year was 2015-01-01, so
the ISO year 2015 begins on the preceding Monday, 2014-12-29.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_DIFF('2017-12-30', '2014-12-30', YEAR) AS year_diff,
  DATE_DIFF('2017-12-30', '2014-12-30', ISOYEAR) AS isoyear_diff;

+-----------+--------------+
| year_diff | isoyear_diff |
+-----------+--------------+
| 3         | 2            |
+-----------+--------------+
```

The following example shows the result of `DATE_DIFF` for two days in
succession. The first date falls on a Monday and the second date falls on a
Sunday. `DATE_DIFF` with the date part `WEEK` returns 0 because this date part
uses weeks that begin on Sunday. `DATE_DIFF` with the date part `WEEK(MONDAY)`
returns 1. `DATE_DIFF` with the date part `ISOWEEK` also returns 1 because
ISO weeks begin on Monday.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_DIFF('2017-12-18', '2017-12-17', WEEK) AS week_diff,
  DATE_DIFF('2017-12-18', '2017-12-17', WEEK(MONDAY)) AS week_weekday_diff,
  DATE_DIFF('2017-12-18', '2017-12-17', ISOWEEK) AS isoweek_diff;

+-----------+-------------------+--------------+
| week_diff | week_weekday_diff | isoweek_diff |
+-----------+-------------------+--------------+
| 0         | 1                 | 1            |
+-----------+-------------------+--------------+
```

### DATE_TRUNC

```sql
DATE_TRUNC(date_expression, date_part)
```

**Description**

Truncates a `DATE` value to the granularity of `date_part`. The `DATE` value
is always rounded to the beginning of `date_part`, which can be one of the
following:

+ `DAY`: The day in the Gregorian calendar year that contains the
  `DATE` value.
+ `WEEK`: The first day of the week in the week that contains the
  `DATE` value. Weeks begin on Sundays. `WEEK` is equivalent to
  `WEEK(SUNDAY)`.
+ `WEEK(WEEKDAY)`: The first day of the week in the week that contains the
  `DATE` value. Weeks begin on `WEEKDAY`. `WEEKDAY` must be one of the
   following: `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`,
   or `SATURDAY`.
+ `ISOWEEK`: The first day of the [ISO 8601 week][ISO-8601-week] in the
  ISO week that contains the `DATE` value. The ISO week begins on
  Monday. The first ISO week of each ISO year contains the first Thursday of the
  corresponding Gregorian calendar year.
+ `MONTH`: The first day of the month in the month that contains the
  `DATE` value.
+ `QUARTER`: The first day of the quarter in the quarter that contains the
  `DATE` value.
+ `YEAR`: The first day of the year in the year that contains the
  `DATE` value.
+ `ISOYEAR`: The first day of the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601] week-numbering year
  in the ISO year that contains the `DATE` value. The ISO year is the
  Monday of the first week whose Thursday belongs to the corresponding
  Gregorian calendar year.

<!-- mdlint on -->

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC(DATE '2008-12-25', MONTH) AS month;

+------------+
| month      |
+------------+
| 2008-12-01 |
+------------+
```

In the following example, the original date falls on a Sunday. Because
the `date_part` is `WEEK(MONDAY)`, `DATE_TRUNC` returns the `DATE` for the
preceding Monday.

```sql
SELECT date AS original, DATE_TRUNC(date, WEEK(MONDAY)) AS truncated
FROM (SELECT DATE('2017-11-05') AS date);

+------------+------------+
| original   | truncated  |
+------------+------------+
| 2017-11-05 | 2017-10-30 |
+------------+------------+
```

In the following example, the original `date_expression` is in the Gregorian
calendar year 2015. However, `DATE_TRUNC` with the `ISOYEAR` date part
truncates the `date_expression` to the beginning of the ISO year, not the
Gregorian calendar year. The first Thursday of the 2015 calendar year was
2015-01-01, so the ISO year 2015 begins on the preceding Monday, 2014-12-29.
Therefore the ISO year boundary preceding the `date_expression` 2015-06-15 is
2014-12-29.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('2015-06-15', ISOYEAR) AS isoyear_boundary,
  EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM DATE '2015-06-15') AS isoyear_number;

+------------------+----------------+
| isoyear_boundary | isoyear_number |
+------------------+----------------+
| 2014-12-29       | 2015           |
+------------------+----------------+
```

### DATE_FROM_UNIX_DATE

```sql
DATE_FROM_UNIX_DATE(int64_expression)
```

**Description**

Interprets `int64_expression` as the number of days since 1970-01-01.

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Example**

```sql
SELECT DATE_FROM_UNIX_DATE(14238) AS date_from_epoch;

+-----------------+
| date_from_epoch |
+-----------------+
| 2008-12-25      |
+-----------------+
```

### FORMAT_DATE

```sql
FORMAT_DATE(format_string, date_expr)
```

**Description**

Formats the `date_expr` according to the specified `format_string`.

See [Supported Format Elements For DATE][date-format-elements]
for a list of format elements that this function supports.

**Return Data Type**

STRING

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT FORMAT_DATE("%x", DATE "2008-12-25") AS US_format;

+------------+
| US_format  |
+------------+
| 12/25/08   |
+------------+
```

```sql
SELECT FORMAT_DATE("%b-%d-%Y", DATE "2008-12-25") AS formatted;

+-------------+
| formatted   |
+-------------+
| Dec-25-2008 |
+-------------+
```

```sql
SELECT FORMAT_DATE("%b %Y", DATE "2008-12-25") AS formatted;

+-------------+
| formatted   |
+-------------+
| Dec 2008    |
+-------------+
```

### LAST_DAY

```sql
LAST_DAY(date_expression[, date_part])
```

**Description**

Returns the last day from a date expression. This is commonly used to return
the last day of the month.

You can optionally specify the date part for which the last day is returned.
If this parameter is not used, the default value is `MONTH`.
`LAST_DAY` supports the following values for `date_part`:

+  `YEAR`
+  `QUARTER`
+  `MONTH`
+  `WEEK`. Equivalent to 7 `DAY`s.
+  `WEEK(<WEEKDAY>)`. `<WEEKDAY>` represents the starting day of the week.
   Valid values are `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`,
   `FRIDAY`, and `SATURDAY`.
+  `ISOWEEK`. Uses [ISO 8601][ISO-8601-week] week boundaries. ISO weeks begin
   on Monday.
+  `ISOYEAR`. Uses the [ISO 8601][ISO-8601] week-numbering year boundary.
   The ISO year boundary is the Monday of the first week whose Thursday belongs
   to the corresponding Gregorian calendar year.

**Return Data Type**

`DATE`

**Example**

These both return the last day of the month:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE '2008-11-25', MONTH) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-30 |
+------------+
```

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE '2008-11-25') AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-30 |
+------------+
```

This returns the last day of the year:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE '2008-11-25', YEAR) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-12-31 |
+------------+
```

This returns the last day of the week for a week that starts on a Sunday:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE '2008-11-10', WEEK(SUNDAY)) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-15 |
+------------+
```

This returns the last day of the week for a week that starts on a Monday:

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE '2008-11-10', WEEK(MONDAY)) AS last_day

+------------+
| last_day   |
+------------+
| 2008-11-16 |
+------------+
```

### PARSE_DATE

```sql
PARSE_DATE(format_string, date_string)
```

**Description**

Converts a [string representation of date][date-format] to a
`DATE` object.

`format_string` contains the [format elements][date-format-elements]
that define how `date_string` is formatted. Each element in
`date_string` must have a corresponding element in `format_string`. The
location of each element in `format_string` must match the location of
each element in `date_string`.

```sql
-- This works because elements on both sides match.
SELECT PARSE_DATE("%A %b %e %Y", "Thursday Dec 25 2008")

-- This doesn't work because the year element is in different locations.
SELECT PARSE_DATE("%Y %A %b %e", "Thursday Dec 25 2008")

-- This doesn't work because one of the year elements is missing.
SELECT PARSE_DATE("%A %b %e", "Thursday Dec 25 2008")

-- This works because %F can find all matching elements in date_string.
SELECT PARSE_DATE("%F", "2000-12-30")
```

The format string fully supports most format elements except for
`%g`, `%G`, `%j`, `%u`, `%U`, `%V`, `%w`, and `%W`.

When using `PARSE_DATE`, keep the following in mind:

+ **Unspecified fields.** Any unspecified field is initialized from `1970-01-01`.
+ **Case insensitivity.** Names, such as `Monday`, `February`, and so on, are
  case insensitive.
+ **Whitespace.** One or more consecutive white spaces in the format string
  matches zero or more consecutive white spaces in the date string. In
  addition, leading and trailing white spaces in the date string are always
  allowed -- even if they are not in the format string.
+ **Format precedence.** When two (or more) format elements have overlapping
  information (for example both `%F` and `%Y` affect the year), the last one
  generally overrides any earlier ones.

**Return Data Type**

DATE

**Examples**

This example converts a `MM/DD/YY` formatted string to a `DATE` object:

```sql
SELECT PARSE_DATE("%x", "12/25/08") AS parsed;

+------------+
| parsed     |
+------------+
| 2008-12-25 |
+------------+
```

This example converts a `YYYYMMDD` formatted string to a `DATE` object:

```sql
SELECT PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", "20081225") AS parsed;

+------------+
| parsed     |
+------------+
| 2008-12-25 |
+------------+
```

### UNIX_DATE

```sql
UNIX_DATE(date_expression)
```

**Description**

Returns the number of days since 1970-01-01.

**Return Data Type**

INT64

**Example**

```sql
SELECT UNIX_DATE(DATE "2008-12-25") AS days_from_epoch;

+-----------------+
| days_from_epoch |
+-----------------+
| 14238           |
+-----------------+
```
