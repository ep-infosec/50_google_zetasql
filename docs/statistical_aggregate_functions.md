# Statistical aggregate functions

The following statistical aggregate functions are available in
ZetaSQL. To learn about the syntax for aggregate function calls, see
[Aggregate function calls][agg-function-calls].

### CORR

```sql
CORR(
  X1, X2
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } expression2 ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]

over_clause:
  { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

window_specification:
  [ named_window ]
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
  [ window_frame_clause ]

```

**Description**

Returns the [Pearson coefficient][stat-agg-link-to-pearson-coefficient]
of correlation of a set of number pairs. For each number pair, the first number
is the dependent variable and the second number is the independent variable.
The return result is between `-1` and `1`. A result of `0` indicates no
correlation.

All numeric types are supported. If the
input is `NUMERIC` or `BIGNUMERIC` then the internal aggregation is
stable with the final output converted to a `DOUBLE`.
Otherwise the input is converted to a `DOUBLE`
before aggregation, resulting in a potentially unstable result.

This function ignores any input pairs that contain one or more NULL values. If
there are fewer than two input pairs without NULL values, this function returns
NULL.

### COVAR_POP

```sql
COVAR_POP(
  X1, X2
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } expression2 ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]

over_clause:
  { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

window_specification:
  [ named_window ]
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
  [ window_frame_clause ]

```

**Description**

Returns the population [covariance][stat-agg-link-to-covariance] of
a set of number pairs. The first number is the dependent variable; the second
number is the independent variable. The return result is between `-Inf` and
`+Inf`.

All numeric types are supported. If the
input is `NUMERIC` or `BIGNUMERIC` then the internal aggregation is
stable with the final output converted to a `DOUBLE`.
Otherwise the input is converted to a `DOUBLE`
before aggregation, resulting in a potentially unstable result.

This function ignores any input pairs that contain one or more NULL values. If
there is no input pair without NULL values, this function returns NULL. If there
is exactly one input pair without NULL values, this function returns 0.

### COVAR_SAMP

```sql
COVAR_SAMP(
  X1, X2
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } expression2 ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]

over_clause:
  { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

window_specification:
  [ named_window ]
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
  [ window_frame_clause ]

```

**Description**

Returns the sample [covariance][stat-agg-link-to-covariance] of a
set of number pairs. The first number is the dependent variable; the second
number is the independent variable. The return result is between `-Inf` and
`+Inf`.

All numeric types are supported. If the
input is `NUMERIC` or `BIGNUMERIC` then the internal aggregation is
stable with the final output converted to a `DOUBLE`.
Otherwise the input is converted to a `DOUBLE`
before aggregation, resulting in a potentially unstable result.

This function ignores any input pairs that contain one or more NULL values. If
there are fewer than two input pairs without NULL values, this function returns
NULL.

### STDDEV_POP

```sql
STDDEV_POP(
  [ DISTINCT ]
  expression
  [ HAVING { MAX | MIN } expression2 ]
)
[ OVER over_clause ]

over_clause:
  { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }

window_specification:
  [ named_window ]
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression [, ...] ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [ { ASC | DESC }  ] [, ...] ]
  [ window_frame_clause ]

```

**Description**

Returns the population (biased) standard deviation of the values. The return
result is between `0` and `+Inf`.

All numeric types are supported. If the
input is `NUMERIC` or `BIGNUMERIC` then the internal aggregation is
stable with the final output converted to a `DOUBLE`.
Otherwise the input is converted to a `DOUBLE`
before aggregation, resulting in a potentially unstable result.

This function ignores any NULL inputs. If all inputs are ignored, this function
returns NULL.

If this function receives a single non-NULL input, it returns `0`.
