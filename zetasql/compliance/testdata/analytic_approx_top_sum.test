# Tests for APPROX_TOP_SUM used as an analytic function.  Note that due
# to the approximate nature of the function, exact results are not guaranteed.
# For this small test case, it may be valuable to detect if an engine cannot
# give exact results even though these results are not guaranteed as per
# ZetaSQL semantics.  If the test results become problematic for engines
# as they enable the function, then the query will need to be updated to make
# the result check more fuzzy (such as by ensuring that we return the correct
# number of rows rather than checking the values of the rows).
